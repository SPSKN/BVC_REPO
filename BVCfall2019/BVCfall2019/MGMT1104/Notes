What we know so far:
- Cam Plug is a venture startup trying to develop and commercialize a new product
- the product is an industrial type of power plug (not the residential kind)
- the plug will have embedded sensors and some kind of microcontroller
- the plug can monitor temperature and power load
- the plug can communicate with a network and be remotely observed/controlled
- the plug will be engineered to withstand severe environments (water, dust, vibration)
- the plug will be certified by safety and standards compliance agencies such as UL and FCC (edited)

How this is a tremendous opportunity for students in our software development program:
- you get to participate in an early-stage venture
- you get firsthand experience dealing with a real-life stakeholder, who does not have any Agile experience
- you get direct experience eliciting requirements and story mapping
- you get to contribute to the success of a new product in the market
- if your work is high enough quality, you will get your name attached to the project as a contributor (edited) 
Background and research:
- the key stakeholder is visiting the class on Tuesday October 22 at 0800h.
- it goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that latecomers will not be admitted to this class
- prior to his visit, please read the links below for some background
- I don't expect you to become experts in industrial automation or controls, but try to get a big picture
- plan on being the product owner for this venture: it will replace the existing MGMT1104 final project
- there is no other information available at this point; we're all in discovery together
- plan on asking intelligent questions at the class stakeholder meeting next week! (edited)
